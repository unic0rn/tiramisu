tiramisu irc client
===================

#### History ####

The development of this IRC client started few years ago, when flash player 9 beta was released by Adobe. It was called eris back then, but it was renamed to tiramisu some time later. I've used flex 3 at the beginning, but as time progressed, I've switched to flex 4 and flash player 10 for some new UI effects. The fact that it used to work under flash player 9 can be seen in the usage of as3crypto library, which provides ssl support independent from flash player runtime. The whole IRC client is certainly far from being complete (no /ignore for example) and I'm sure it still may have some bugs, but it works quite well for few communities already, so I guess it's pretty well tested so far.

#### Compiling ####

The code is ugly, I know that. It was written across few years, changes were made upon changes, fixes upon fixes and workarounds upon workarounds, so it's a miracle it still works ;) The last version of flex sdk it was tested with is [flex 4.1] (<http://sourceforge.net/adobe/flexsdk/wiki/Download%20Flex%204/>) - so use that to compile it or things are guaranteed not to work as supposed.

#### Roadmap ####

Shortly? There is none. I have no time currently to work on this project, mainly because there's little to none commercial interest in it - and that's unfortunately what affects my priorities when it comes to 'what do I code next'. It's also the reason why I'm releasing the source code - quite a few people asked about it, so here it is. The code should be cleaned up, updated to support the latest flex sdk version, it should use spark components instead of halo, the list can go on. I had some plans for tiramisu, because it was always my pet project, but right now it's pretty low on my priority list. If you want to change that, or if you just find this little IRC client useful, feel free to donate via paypal - my email address is in my profile.
